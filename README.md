# Microbit-game
This is a micro:bit game where you catch a dot (you can think that it is an apple), and you get 1 point every time you catch it.
When you reach 10 or 20 points, it will show how many points you have, and when you reach 30 points, you win the game.
You can copy it from main.ts and to put it to the MakeCode Editor, first create a new project, then give it a name, switch to javascript (it is typescript but they call it javascript) code, and then paste the code. That's all.
